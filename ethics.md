	There is one major concern about building a social media app, and it is one that the world is still coming
to terms with. That concern, naturally, is misinformation. As current events have demonstrated with Elon Musk
and the takeover of Twitter, misinformation and hate speech can proliferate in social media in a way that truly
makes the world a terrible place. Hate speech and misinformation led to the destruction of the power grid in North
Carolina, misinformation and hate led to the reepeal of Roe v. Wade, and misinformation and scientific illiteracy
led to the explosion of the COVID-19 pandemic. As software engineers coming up with a social media app, it is 
our responsibility to ensure that we do not allow the spread of misinformation online.

	Misinformation on the internet has led to several global concerns, the easiest of which to understand is the
COVID-19 pandemic. Social media platforms allowed the rampant spread of legitimate-looking sources saying all kinds
of crazy things, like that the vaccines made people magnetic, or that wearing a mask gave people carbon dioxide 
poisoning. This directly led to the death of millions. Our management systems were not set up to handle that much 
misinformation, and their use (fact checking, etc.) was allowed to become a politicized topic. Another global concern
that can occur with using social media is mental health. Excessive social media usage can exacerbate anxiety, sadness, 
FOMO, and other mental health disorders. It is our responsibility to never allow that type of misuse of our systems again.

	Misinformation has also generated economic concerns. One has only to look at the subreddit r/wallstreetbets 
to see people making incredibly poor decisions based on nothing at all. NFTs bubbled and then burst, losing some 
(admittedly foolish) investors tons of money because they were sold an idea that is not feasible with our current 
social and economic model. But perhaps the most visceral and uncomfortable economic result of social media is the 
commodification of people's data. We are not consumers, but data points for microtargeting and advertisement. This is
an ethical concern because it takes focus away from human-centric design and focuses of corporate profit-centric 
design. This level of microtargeting must be accounted for and considered when approaching any customer-facing web 
service. However, the social media can also boost the countries' GDP. As most businesses are going online following
the industry 4.0 era, more people can market their products easily and faster. Our software engineers will always help
people who uses the app to be more productive instead of just having fun with the app.

	Honestly, our environmental and social concerns are very linked on the internet, and managing a social media 
app puts us as engineers in a position where we have to decide what information is shareable. Sharing information
about chemtrails may be distasteful and silly, but it generally does not cause direct harm. Spreading information
about how Jews want to take your gas and ban your cows for crazy environmmmental reasons DOES cause harm. It creates 
an environment in which people believe that they are under attack, and that the person attacking them is doing it for
some specific gain, which incentivizes them to work against that goal AND those people. The issue is that without 
environmental reform, the world is only going to get less liveable. It is our responsibility to ensure that there is
a world on which our children can survive, and that is helped by moderation. For example, social media expands the 
public's reach, allowing people to influence changes in the environmental sector on every subject, from shifting away 
from fossil fuel dependency to renewable energy to influencing the dynamic of present climate change talks.
