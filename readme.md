#How to run your website 
Our website is run by Flask and currently has limited button functionality. The signup button routes to the login
page, and the login page routes to '/', but most navigation as of now has to be done in the address line. We have a
messaging page which allows reactions on '/send', but we also have a delete user page at '/deleteconfirm'. In order
to run the website, we need FlaskForm. We also have '/search' functionality to search for added users.

We have about half of our requirements done as of now and intend to finish the rest of them in the next week.
Wilson and Brenna both had a MAJOR project for another class that has been difficult, so they both ended up a little 
behind in this one.
